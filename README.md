question1.py
I wrote a program that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product first exceeds a given threshold. The final product and the integer that caused it to exceed the threshold are printed.

question2.py
I created a function that takes a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary containing the length of each string and whether the length is even or odd.

question3.py
I defined a function to compute powers and safely applied it to a list of (x, y) pairs. Any pair with a negative exponent is skipped, and valid results are stored and printed.

question4.py
I generated a list of random values, sorted it, and found the indices where values are greater than or equal to a randomly generated value x. The first matching index is printed if it exists.

question5.py
I wrote a function that validates two circle radii, computes their areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle. A meaningful message is returned for invalid input.

question6.py
I implemented a function that analyzes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary showing the percentage of elements less than or equal to each unique value in the list.

question7.py
I created a function that converts seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format, with input validation.

question8.py
I used pandas to create a DataFrame from given data and added a new column derived from existing columns, then printed the final DataFrame.
